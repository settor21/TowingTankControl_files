# TowingTankControl_files
Final Capstone Project. 

MATLAB app controls the towing tank for data collection and experimentation.

Arduino Code allows for running of a linear stage in longitudinal (x) and lateral (y) axes. 

MATLAB app (demo) can be used to edit the interface capability only. 

MATLAB app (final) can be used to run the program for the tank. 

tankMotorcode.m can be used to generate the GCODE profile for any function.
